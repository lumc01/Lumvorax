# LUM/VORAX Computational System

## Overview
This is a sophisticated C-based computational system implementing the LUM/VORAX framework. The system provides high-performance computational operations on LUM (presence units) structures using advanced optimization techniques including SIMD vectorization and parallel processing.

## Current State
- **Status**: Successfully imported and configured for Replit environment
- **Build System**: C/Clang with optimized Makefiles
- **Core Modules**: Functional and tested
- **Deployment**: Configured for VM deployment

## Recent Changes
- **2024-09-20**: Successfully imported GitHub project to Replit
- **2024-09-20**: Fixed compilation issues and built core system
- **2024-09-20**: Configured workflow and deployment settings

## Project Architecture
The system consists of several key modules:

### Core Modules (Compiled and Working)
- **LUM Core** (`src/lum/`): Basic LUM structure management
- **VORAX Operations** (`src/vorax/`): Group operations and transformations
- **Parser** (`src/parser/`): VORAX command parsing
- **Binary Converter** (`src/binary/`): Binary data conversion
- **Logger** (`src/logger/`): Logging and monitoring
- **Debug Tools** (`src/debug/`): Memory tracking and forensic logging

### Advanced Modules (Available but not in simple build)
- **Matrix Calculator**: Advanced matrix operations
- **Quantum Simulator**: Quantum computation simulation
- **Neural Networks**: Neural network processing
- **Audio/Image Processing**: Multimedia processing
- **Optimization**: SIMD, memory, and performance optimizations

## Build Configuration
- **Simple Build**: `make -f Makefile.simple` - Builds core modules only
- **Complete Build**: `make` - Attempts to build all modules (some compilation issues)
- **Binary Location**: `bin/lum_vorax_simple`

## Running the System
The system runs as a console application that demonstrates:
- LUM creation and management
- Group operations
- Memory tracking
- Basic computational operations

## Current Issues
- Minor memory tracking issue in cleanup phase (non-critical)
- Some advanced modules have compilation dependencies that need fixing
- System exits with memory error but core functionality works correctly

## Technical Specifications
- **Language**: C99 with GCC/Clang
- **Dependencies**: pthread, libm, librt
- **Optimization**: AVX512, SIMD vectorization support
- **Memory Management**: Custom tracking and forensic logging
- **Threading**: Multi-threaded with pthread support

## Development Notes
- The system uses advanced memory tracking for debugging
- Forensic logging is enabled for detailed operation tracing
- The codebase includes extensive optimization for high-performance computing
- Multiple build configurations available for different deployment scenarios
