# LUM/VORAX System Project Documentation

## Overview
LUM/VORAX is a sophisticated C-based forensic analysis and performance testing framework with advanced memory tracking, cryptographic validation, and neural network processing capabilities. The system includes both C core components and Python report generation scripts.

## Project Architecture

### Core C Application (`./bin/lum_vorax`)
- **Main Entry Point**: `src/main.c` - Demonstrates all system capabilities
- **LUM Core**: `src/lum/` - Basic LUM (Light Unit Memory) operations and structures  
- **VORAX Operations**: `src/vorax/` - Advanced operations (fuse, split, cycle)
- **Parser**: `src/parser/` - VORAX language parser and AST
- **Binary Conversion**: `src/binary/` - Binary to LUM conversion utilities
- **Logging System**: `src/logger/` - Comprehensive logging with auto-archiving
- **Persistence**: `src/persistence/` - Data storage with WAL and recovery
- **Optimization**: `src/optimization/` - SIMD, Pareto, and memory optimizers
- **Advanced Modules**: `src/advanced_calculations/` - Neural networks, quantum simulation
- **Crypto**: `src/crypto/` - Cryptographic validation and homomorphic encryption
- **Debug**: `src/debug/` - Memory tracking and forensic logging

### Python Report Generation
- `generate_forensic_report.py` - Complete forensic analysis with compilation testing
- `generate_scientific_report.py` - Scientific evidence package generation
- `generate_rapport_forensique_authentique.py` - French forensic reporting
- `generate_rapport_forensique_final.py` - Final forensic reporting

## Build System
- **Makefile**: Uses Clang with strict warnings and optimization flags
- **Dependencies**: pthread, libm, librt for threading and math operations
- **Output**: `./bin/lum_vorax` executable

## Key Features

### Memory Management
- Complete memory tracking with allocation/deallocation logging
- Protection against double-free vulnerabilities
- Zero-tolerance error handling with forensic logging

### Forensic Capabilities
- Detailed timing measurements using CLOCK_MONOTONIC for precision
- Complete audit trail of all operations
- SHA-256 validation of code and data integrity
- Comprehensive logging system with automatic session archiving

### Performance Testing
- Stress testing with millions of LUMs
- Parallel processing capabilities
- SIMD optimization for performance-critical operations
- Pareto optimization algorithms

### Advanced Computing
- Neural network processing with blackbox modules
- Quantum simulation capabilities
- Mathematical research engines
- Matrix calculations with optimization

## Current State (2025-09-19)
âœ… **Fully Functional in Replit Environment**
- C application compiles successfully with Clang
- All demo scenarios execute without memory leaks
- Python report generators working with forensic analysis
- Workflow configured for console output
- Comprehensive logging and memory tracking active

## Recent Changes
**Date**: 2025-01-19 17:20:00 UTC (from README.md roadmap)
- Addressed LUM size inconsistencies (48 bytes vs 32 bytes)
- Enhanced double-free protection with ultra-secure mechanisms
- Implemented differentiated timing systems (MONOTONIC vs REALTIME)
- Standardized header guards across all modules
- Added zero-tolerance error handling patterns

## User Preferences
- Language: Mixed French/English (system messages in French, technical terms preserved)
- Focus: Forensic analysis and ultra-strict validation
- Style: Detailed logging with comprehensive memory tracking
- Architecture: Modular design with clear separation of concerns

## Running the System

### C Application
```bash
make clean && make    # Build the system
./bin/lum_vorax      # Run demo scenarios
```

### Python Reports
```bash
python3 generate_forensic_report.py      # Complete forensic analysis
python3 generate_scientific_report.py    # Scientific evidence package
```

## Generated Artifacts
- **Logs**: Complete execution logs with memory tracking
- **Reports**: Forensic analysis in JSON format with SHA-256 validation
- **Evidence**: Scientific evidence packages with checksums
- **Database**: Test persistence database with 1000+ LUM entries

## Technical Notes
- Uses POSIX threading for parallel operations
- Implements custom memory allocator with tracking
- Advanced cryptographic validation throughout
- Supports complex data structures with validation patterns
- Complete AST-based parser for VORAX domain language

This system represents a complete forensic analysis framework with enterprise-grade memory management and validation capabilities.
