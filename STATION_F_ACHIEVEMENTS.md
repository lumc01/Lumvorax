# Question : Tell us more about your achievements since you started the project

Since the inception of VGACTEC, we have transitioned from a conceptual framework to a fully industrial-grade scientific computing system. Our key achievements include:

1. **Development of LUMVORAX V4 (VESUVIUS)**: 
   We successfully engineered and stabilized the fourth major iteration of our core kernel. This version integrates a high-performance C++ backend (`liblumvorax.so`) with a versatile Python frontend, ensuring both raw speed and ease of use.

2. **Full 360° Certification**: 
   As of February 21, 2026, the system has achieved "Definitive Certification." This wasn't just a internal milestone; it involved passing a rigorous battery of 3,600 automated tests covering unit logic, integration stability, and forensic traceability.

3. **High-Compatibility Architecture**: 
   We achieved near-universal Linux compatibility by compiling our native components against GLIBC 2.2.5. This allows VGACTEC to run on almost any infrastructure, from legacy servers to modern cloud environments, without dependency hell.

4. **Integration of Advanced Scientific Modules**: 
   We have successfully integrated and optimized heavy-duty libraries including PyTorch (for neural computing), OpenCV (for computer vision), and SciPy. Our system now handles complex multi-dimensional data processing with native efficiency.

5. **Neural Blackbox Traceability**: 
   We developed a proprietary forensic logging system (Série 039/040/047) that provides line-by-line execution transparency. This is a critical achievement for our target markets in highly regulated industries.

6. **Self-Taught Excellence**: 
   Perhaps our greatest achievement is that this entire stack—from the low-level memory management (Slab Allocators) to the high-level API contracts—was built entirely by our "unconventional" team, outperforming many academic prototypes in both stability and raw performance.
